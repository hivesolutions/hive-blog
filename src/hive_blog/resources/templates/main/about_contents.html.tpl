        <p>My name is <i>Tiago Silva</i> and I work at <i>Hive Solutions</i>, mainly as a developer, but in this case, also as some kind of wannabe journalist.</p>
        <p>Little after I could read and write, I was tampering with the memory addresses on my Commodore Amiga to get infinite energy and cheat my way through computer games, when I should have been outside playing football like normal kids.</p>
        <p>Throughout life I have been obsessed with random and sometimes purposeless skills and subjects like martial arts, juggling, foreign languages, neural networks, psychology, neuro linguistic programming, speed reading, monty python, stand-up comedy, latin dances, philosophy or just trying to memorize a deck of playing cards in under three minutes for no reason whatsoever.</p>
        <p>I have left my work at <i>Microsoft</i> in <i>Denmark</i> to co-found <i>Hive</i>, and while in the office, when not found programming with my headphones blasting loud music, I can be found juggling in the corridors, refining my backup strategy for getting money to return home in case I am mugged in my next random backpacking trip.</p>
